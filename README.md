## ‚ú® Features

* **Empathetic AI Persona:** The Gemini-2.5-Pro model is configured with a specific system prompt to act as "Amica," a highly empathetic, non-judgmental, and caring mental health companion.
* **Critical Safety Override:** Implements a strict, hardcoded safety check for suicide-related keywords. If triggered, it immediately provides a pre-defined safety message and the helpline number **`911`**, overriding the standard AI response.
* **Voice Input (STT):** Uses the `speech_recognition` library to transcribe user speech from a microphone into text input.
* **Voice Output (TTS):** Uses the `gTTS` library to convert Amica's text responses into speech, played back directly in the Streamlit interface.
* **Custom UI/UX:** Features a highly customized Streamlit interface with a clean, white background and distinct, visually appealing chat bubble styling.
